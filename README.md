To develop it I used the Jikan API which is a free API that supports CORS. Check it out if you want. https://jikan.moe/
I used ejs, css, express and axios to develop the site.
To try it => first clone this project. Then run "npm install" to download the dependencies. Then run the app using "nodemon index.js";
